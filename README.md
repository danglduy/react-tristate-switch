# react-tristate-switch

This is a demo of a tri-state switch React Component using Framer Motion

Base code is from this [codesandbox](https://codesandbox.io/s/framer-motion-automatic-animation-switch-demo-bgun4?file=/src/styles.css:378-453). Hope you enjoy :).

## Notes

The original codesandbox is written with Framer Motion 2. Since then Framer Motion's version has been bumped to 4 and the animation seems not to be smooth as on the original sandbox. I will try fixing this issue when the time is convenient.
